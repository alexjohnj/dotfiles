## Working Together

- Always call out bad ideas or mistakes.

## Coding Style

- Only add comments that highlight specific details that may not be obvious.
- Only add comments when they describe what the code does now.

## Plan Mode

- Always ask for clarification if something is unclear.
- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
