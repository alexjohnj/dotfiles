## Working Together

- Always call out bad ideas or mistakes.

## Coding Style

- Only add comments that highlight specific details that may not be obvious.
- Only add comments when they describe what the code does now.

## Plan Mode

- Ask questions, don't assume. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool.
- Do not create the plan until all questions are answered.
